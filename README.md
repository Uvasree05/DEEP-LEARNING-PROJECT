# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT
This project trains a Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset using scikit-learn.
It uses a pipeline with StandardScaler for normalization and LinearRegression for modeling.
Data is split into training and test sets for proper validation.
The trained model pipeline is serialized and saved as model.pkl using joblib.
This model can be deployed or reused for predicting housing prices based on input features.
